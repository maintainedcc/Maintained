## Nightly

The nightly branch is no longer a monorepo project. Other Maintained projects can be found on the GitHub org [maintainedcc](https://github.com/maintainedcc).

Nightly preview builds can be found at [https://nightly.maintained.cc](https://nightly.maintained.cc). They are not guaranteed to be stable or have 100% uptime, and the data is not synchronized with Maintained in production.

## Legacy (Deployed)

The legacy version of Maintained can be found at [origin/legacy](https://github.com/maintainedcc/Maintained/tree/legacy). This is the version in production.

In the future, Maintained will be updated to tagged releases on this branch.

## Use Cases

Some cool stuff you can do with Maintained:

- Live development status (like this README!)
- Repository support status
- Make any API endpoint into a badge (Preview)

## Features

### (Better) Per-Branch Badging

[![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/9](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/9)](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/9/redirect)

### Live Update

![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/3](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/3?)

The web dashboard autosaves your changes and updates badges without changing the URL. That means once the badge is committed, you have full manual control of content and no more commits need to be made. This README uses Maintained badges to update development status on features!

### Dynamic Value Sources

![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/4](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/4?)

Use the powerful built-in syntax to dynamically pull data anywhere from the web in a variety of formats including plaintext, JSON, and with regular expressions. More formats may be considered.

Alternatively, POST to a Maintained API endpoint to update your badges from your application - excellent for private API endpoints or services.

### Super Stylish Styles

![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/5](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/5?)

Badges are all about style, and we're adding many! The badge above shows what styles we have so far. Each style supports a variety of colors for maximum style points. Create badges with both a title and value, or mono badges with just a title. Got style suggestions? Pull requests are welcome!

### Link Direct

![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/6](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/6?)

Link Direct allows users to enter in redirect URLs for badges on their Maintained dashboard. It allows the user to update where their badge redirect URLs point to (in Markdown, text, links, or other places) all without ever having to update or commit anything new.

### GitHub OAuth

![https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/7](https://maintained.cc/SDBagel/Maintained/7?)

No account needed! Just one click to start with your GitHub account with only public data. Revoke your token any time.
